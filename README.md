<h1>Attrition Visualization Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project's goal was to analyze the correlation between various job factors and employee attrition rates within a dataset comprising 1500 employees across different industries. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the project uncovered insights into the factors influencing attrition, in order to aid organization's in creating targeted retention strategies. 

<h2>Application</h2>

- <b>Tableau</b> 


<h2>Presentation:</h2>

<p align="center">
Attrition by Distance: <br/>
   - The goal of this report was to see how much distance played a part in attrition. <br/>
   - As the report shows, the blue portion of the bar stands for the amount of employees who did not leave their job. The Yellow are the amount who did. <br/>
   - The graph is skewed indicating that most people don't travel too far for work. However, it shows that attrition is not common amongst those who travel between 0-11 miles. <br/>
   - Once the distance reaches 12 miles, we see that employees don't typically live this far from work. <br/>
   - However, we  see that the ones that do, are far more likely to quit their jobs. <br/>

Income by Job Role: <br/>
   - This report examines the yearly salary of specific job roles and at what point do we see attrition based on them. <br/>
   - As we can see, there is a trend that the lower the combined salary is relative to the position, the more likely there is to be attrition amongst those employees.  <br/>
   - For example, at an HR job, with employees who made under the $20,000 mark, the more likely they were to quit compared to those making over that . <br/>
   - The same can be said in jobs with considerably higher salaries. <br/>
   - For example, at the managerial level, manager's making less then $65,000 a year, were more likely to quit their job then manager's making more. <br/>
   - This can help us come to the possible conslusion that when employees see that other people in their poition are making more then them, they will be more likely to leave. <br/>

Attrition by Job Role: <br/>
   - This next report shows us the job roles and the attrition numbers. <br/>
   - This allowed us to break down what roles had the highest attrition rates. This way we can help organizations on where to focus when it comes to retaining employees.  <br/>
   - As it shows, Sales representative's seem to have the highest attrition rate. With 66% of employees in the dataset, leaving thier companies. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Attrition by Years at Company:  <br/>
   - This report shows us Attrition based on the amount of years an employee was at a company.  <br/>
   - As the graph shows, we can see that attrition rates are only present in the first 10-11 years employees are at companies.  <br/>
   - The lower the amount of years an employee is at a company, the more likely they are to quit.  <br/>
   - Once they hit that 12 year mark, an employee's liklihood to quit is almost 0%.  <br/>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
After looking at this data, we can see the common trends that can help us paint the story on why people are leaving companies.  <br/>
  1. Long commuting times <br/>
    - As mentioned earlier, once the distance traveled to work reaches 12 miles, the employee is more likely to leave that job. I suggest that in the hiring process, companies should take this information into account. If an employee lives further away, know that they are more likely to leave then someone who lives much closer to the job site.  <br/>
 <br />
  2. Competitive Salaries <br/>
     - This report also showed that people will leave based on what others companies are offering their employees. This was seen in every position. Offer employees competitive salaries based on what other companies are offering. If that is not possible look for other ways to incentivise them to stay. Bonuses, Vacation days, Professional development, etc.  <br/>
 <br />
  3. High Turnover Positions <br/>
     - The report also showed us what positions have higher attrition rates then others. Focus in on those positions. Make sure those employees are satisfied and find extra ways to incentivise them to stay. This goes back to the competitive salaries point. They must be presented with a reason as to why they should choose to stay.  <br/>
 <br />
  4. Tenured Employees <br/>
     - The data also shows that new employees who have been at the company for 2 years are far more likely to leave, while employees who have been at the company for 12 years or more are unlikely to leave. Once again, focus in on those new employees. Make sure they're satisifed with their work. Also, have the tenured employees of over 12 years talk to them and tell them what had kept them here for this much time.  <br/>
  
<br />
<br />
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Based off of the dataset given to us, we can see that they're many different factors that can lead to attrition within organizations. Factors such as commuting distance, salary, job role, and tenure can help us draw conclusion's on why people are leaving their jobs. These findings can help organizations create action items that will help lead to a culture that promotes low turnover.
